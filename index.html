		<h2>What RAD.js is:</h2>
		<p>A system-level framework. It allows to build a single-page application that looks and feels as a conventional multi-page one. It also takes over system-level tasks, such as message bus, creating and deleting certain part instances of the application, transactions between views, etc.</p>
		<h2>What RAD.js isn't:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					An MV* framework. In RAD.js, MV* is based upon BackboneJS;
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					An application-level framework. Any JavaScript object can serve as an application. The framework does not require any special environments for creating an object of the application;
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					A layout engine. The layout engine is implemented as a navigation plugin for the framework core;
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					A UI framework. There is no reason in creating another UI framework, because in real-life projects UI patterns and appearance of applications change. ScrollableView, PopupView and ToastView serve as an extension to the basic view; all of these have extended and frequent behavior in different projects. You can easily write new views (such as ListView), which are frequently used in your projects.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Advantages:</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p> The framework is optimized for PhoneGap and mobile browsers;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Ability to dynamically control (create and delete) module instances of the application through the functionality of the core, at both view level and application level;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Ability to build an application consisting of loosely bound modules: models, views, services (application part without visual representation); and of the object of the application;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Tree-structured messaging;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Debug mode of the core and messages;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Flexible and loosely bound architecture - almost any extraneous code can be enveloped by the module with several lines of code. Failure of a module doesn&#39;t cause failure of the whole application;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Ability to monitor the lifecycle of view and services. Callback methods for all lifecycle events;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Templating. A template is an HTML file that can be created separately;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Partial templating of view. Ability to determine parts of the view template, that will or will not be rerendered by changes of data within a model;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Any JavaScript object can serve as the object of the application;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Ability to extend functionality of the core via plugins;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Complex embedded views and declarative transition animations between them;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Ability to inherit views, services and models;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Modal and non-modal self-positioning windows;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Dynamic routing; it&#39;s enough to set the &#39;&#39;backstack: true&#39;&#39; parameter to enter transaction between views (new position of views on the screen) to the browser history;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Reuse of modules in other projects;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Module testing can be performed through external frameworks.</p>
			</li>
